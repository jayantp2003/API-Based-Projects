<h1>Current Weather presentation using API requests</h1>
<hr>

<p>This is a basic project for understanding how api requests works and how we can implement them into our website to show data. In this project I have made a website which uses api requests to get the weather and present it. I have customised this in such a way that you can get the weather by entering the city.</p>
